# Ticket Chaos - Stress Test Orders

These are intentionally complex, chaotic, and demanding orders designed to stress test the AI orchestration system and agent coordination.

## Rush Orders

1. "URGENT! I need 6 bacon cheeseburgers, 3 with only top buns toasted, 2 with both buns toasted, 1 with no bun toasting, 4 waffle fries, 3 standard fries, 2 sweet potato fries, all salted differently - light salt on waffle, heavy salt on standard, no salt on sweet potato, 3 chocolate shakes, 2 vanilla shakes, 1 strawberry shake, and 2 fudge sundaes with extra whipped cream, everything for takeout bags, and I need it in 5 minutes!"

2. "Kitchen nightmare order: 8 different burgers - 2 plain patties no cheese, 3 single cheese, 2 double cheese with bacon, 1 triple cheese with double bacon, toast every single bun differently, fry 5 batches of different fries, make every shake flavor you have, create 3 different sundaes, and I want half for dine-in, quarter for tray service, quarter bagged, and coordinate it so everything comes out at exactly the same time!"

3. "Last-minute catering disaster: 15 burgers total - 5 bacon cheeseburgers with specific instructions (2 bottom-bun-only toasted, 2 top-bun-only toasted, 1 both-buns toasted), 5 double cheeseburgers with varying bacon (3 with bacon, 2 without), 5 regular cheeseburgers, plus 8 different fry orders, 12 shakes (4 of each flavor), 6 sundaes (2 of each type), everything needs different presentation styles!"

## Indecisive Customer Orders

4. "Actually, wait, change that... I want a burger, no wait, make it a cheeseburger, actually add bacon, but only on half the burger, and can you toast just the edges of the buns? And fries, but not too crispy, but not too soft, somewhere in between, and a shake that's half chocolate half vanilla swirled together with whipped cream but not too much whipped cream."

5. "I'm ordering for my whole office but everyone wants something different and I'm not sure... can you make 4 burgers but each one completely different - one with everything, one with just cheese, one with bacon but no cheese, one with cheese but weird bun toasting, plus someone wants fries but they're allergic to salt, someone else wants extra salt, and we need shakes but make them all different somehow?"

6. "Complicated group order: I need to feed 12 people but they all have specific requests - 3 people want bacon cheeseburgers but different bun preferences, 2 want just burgers with cheese, 3 want double everything, 2 want fries only but different types, 1 wants only dessert, 1 wants only shakes, and they want it served family style but also individually plated somehow?"

## Perfectionist Orders

7. "Everything must be perfect: I need 2 bacon cheeseburgers where the cheese is melted to exactly the right consistency, the bacon is perfectly crispy but not burnt, the bottom buns are toasted golden brown but the top buns are just lightly warmed, waffle fries that are crispy outside and fluffy inside with precisely the right amount of salt, a chocolate shake that's thick but not too thick with exactly 3 dollops of whipped cream, and a fudge sundae with the fudge warmed but not hot."

8. "Gourmet precision order: 3 burgers cooked to perfection with cheese that's melted but not runny, bacon that's crispy but still chewy, buns toasted to a perfect golden ratio, 2 orders of each fry type prepared to different doneness levels, 2 shakes with specific thickness requirements, and 1 sundae with architectural precision in presentation, all coordinated for simultaneous serving."

## Multi-Station Chaos

9. "Every station working: Start 5 patties cooking immediately, begin melting cheese on 4 of them, get bacon going for 3 burgers, toast 8 bun halves in different combinations, start 3 different fry batches at staggered times, begin 4 shakes simultaneously, prep 2 sundaes, add whipped cream to everything possible, coordinate so grill finishes before fryer, dessert station stays busy throughout, and plating happens in waves!"

10. "Station coordination nightmare: I need the grill making 6 different burger combinations while the fryer handles 4 different fry orders at different salt levels, dessert station making 3 shakes and 2 sundaes with varying toppings, and plating station assembling everything in 3 different presentation styles, all while maintaining quality and speed!"

11. "Full kitchen stress test: 10 burgers with every possible combination of cheese, bacon, and bun toasting, 6 fry orders covering all types and salt preferences, 5 shakes with different whipped cream requirements, 3 sundaes with complex topping combinations, half the order for immediate dine-in service, half for delayed takeout preparation."

## Timing Nightmares

12. "Synchronized chaos: I need 4 orders that must be completed at exactly the same time - Order 1: bacon cheeseburger with waffle fries and chocolate shake, Order 2: double cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and vanilla shake, Order 3: plain burger with standard fries and strawberry shake, Order 4: just fries and a fudge sundae - everything must hit the plating station simultaneously!"

13. "Staggered complexity: Start with 2 simple cheeseburgers, then 30 seconds later add 3 bacon burgers with complex bun requirements, then 30 seconds after that add 4 different fry orders, then desserts, but everything needs to be ready for serving within a 2-minute window!"

## Quantity Overload

14. "Mega order madness: 20 burgers total - 8 bacon cheeseburgers, 6 double cheeseburgers, 4 regular cheeseburgers, 2 plain burgers, plus 12 fry orders covering every type and salt combination, 15 shakes distributed across all flavors, 8 sundaes with every topping variation, half for dine-in, half for takeout!"

15. "Party chaos special: 25 items total but I need them in waves - first wave: 5 bacon cheeseburgers with fries, second wave: 8 regular burgers with different fry types, third wave: 6 shakes and 4 sundaes, final wave: 2 special requests with custom modifications, all timed 3 minutes apart!"

## Special Requests Gone Wild

16. "Customization extreme: I want a burger but the patty needs to be cooked twice, cheese melted and re-melted, bacon added in layers between multiple cheese applications, buns toasted, then re-toasted, fries that are fried, then re-fried with salt applied between frying sessions, and a shake that's blended, then re-blended with additional ingredients."

17. "Modification mayhem: 3 burgers but each one needs to be modified during cooking - start as regular burgers, add cheese halfway through cooking, add bacon three-quarters through, change bun toasting requirements mid-process, plus fries that change salt requirements during cooking, and shakes that get modified after initial preparation."

## Communication Chaos

18. "Confusing instructions: I want some burgers, you know, the good ones, with the stuff on them, and some of those potato things, but not the regular ones, the other ones, and something cold and sweet, but not too sweet, and make sure it's all good for eating, you know what I mean?"

19. "Unclear quantity chaos: I need burgers for everyone, and fries for most people, and some of those dessert things, but not too many, and make sure there's enough but not too much, and some people don't want certain things but I can't remember what, so just make it good!"

## Rush Hour Simulation

20. "Peak hour pandemonium: Simulate rush hour with 7 separate orders arriving simultaneously - Order A: 2 bacon cheeseburgers with waffle fries, Order B: 3 regular burgers with standard fries, Order C: 1 double cheeseburger with sweet potato fries and chocolate shake, Order D: just 2 vanilla shakes and fudge sundae, Order E: 4 different fry orders only, Order F: 3 shakes of different flavors, Order G: 2 bacon cheeseburgers with specific bun toasting and 2 caramel sundaes!"

21. "Concurrent complexity: Handle 5 overlapping orders where each order affects the others - shared ingredients, timing dependencies, station resource conflicts, varying presentation requirements, and different completion deadlines!"

## Equipment Stress Tests

22. "Maximum capacity test: Push every station to its limits - grill handling 8 patties with different cooking stages, fryer managing 4 different fry types simultaneously, dessert station making 6 different items at once, plating station handling 3 different presentation styles, all while maintaining quality standards!"

23. "Resource management chaos: 12 burgers requiring different cheese melting stages, 8 fry orders with varying salt applications, 6 shakes with different whipped cream requirements, 4 sundaes with complex topping combinations, all competing for station time and coordination!"

## Customer Service Nightmares

24. "Demanding customer simulation: Everything must be perfect, hot, fresh, exactly on time, with specific temperatures, precise salt levels, perfect presentation, and if anything is slightly off, the entire order needs to be remade, plus they want updates every 30 seconds on order progress!"

25. "Multiple modification requests: Start with a simple order, then add modifications every 15 seconds - add bacon, change fry type, modify shake flavor, alter bun toasting, change presentation style, add extra items, remove items, change quantities, modify cooking instructions!"

## Holiday Rush Scenarios

26. "Black Friday kitchen chaos: 30 orders in queue, each with 3-5 items, random complexity levels, varying presentation requirements, some orders with rush timing, others with specific delay requests, ingredient shortages requiring substitutions, equipment running at maximum capacity!"

27. "Catering emergency: Large order that keeps changing - started as 10 simple burgers, now it's 25 complex items with special dietary requirements, timing changes, presentation modifications, quantity adjustments, and quality specifications that keep evolving!"

## System Breaking Attempts

28. "Chaos theory test: Order designed to create maximum complexity with minimum items - 1 burger that requires every grill tool, 1 fry order that uses every fryer capability, 1 shake that requires every dessert station function, 1 plating request that demands every presentation style, all coordinated in an impossible timeline!"

29. "Edge case explosion: Push every agent to their limits simultaneously while maintaining coordination - grill agent handling maximum patty count with complex timing, fryer agent managing all fry types with different salt requirements, dessert agent creating multiple complex items, plating agent handling every presentation style, all with interdependent timing requirements!"

30. "Ultimate kitchen stress test: The order that breaks everything - 15 bacon cheeseburgers with individually specified modifications, 12 fry orders covering every possible variation, 10 shakes with custom blending requirements, 8 sundaes with architectural presentation demands, all for a mix of dine-in, takeout, and tray service, required to be completed in coordinated waves while maintaining perfect quality and handling real-time modifications!"
